Genomic imprinting is when allele-specific expression occurs in a parent-of-origin manner. Haig's kinship theory predicts that genomic imprinting is due to an evolutionary conflict-of-interest between alleles. In social insects, it has been suggested that genomic imprinting should be widespread. One recent study identified parent-of-origin expression in honeybees and found evidence supporting the kinship theory. However, little is known about genomic imprinting in insects and multiple theoretical predictions must be tested to avoid single-study confirmation bias. We, therefore, tested for parent-of-origin expression in a primitively eusocial bee. We found equal numbers of maternally and paternally expressed alleles. The most highly biased alleles were maternally expressed, offering some support for the kinship theory. However, this theory does not fully explain the patterns we have obtained, showing the need to consider alternative models. We also found low conservation of potentially imprinted genes with the honeybee, suggesting rapid evolution of genomic imprinting in Hymenoptera. 

## Project Team: 

This project is part of the work from the Socioecology and Social Evolution lab in KU Leuven, headed by Prof. Tom Wenseleers [see website](https://bio.kuleuven.be/ento/wenseleers/twenseleers.htm) and the Social Epigenetics group at the Unviersity of Leicester, headed by Dr. Eamonn Mallon, [see website](https://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/selab). The reciprocal crosses were carried out by Biobest (Westerlo, Belgium) under supervision of Prof. Felix Wäckers. Dr. Jelle van Zweden and Dr. Kristof Beneats carried out the behavioural observations and lab work. Dr. Hollie Marshall and Prof. Tom Wenseleers carried out the analyses with input from Dr. Anneleen Van Geystelen.
